1,radical prostatectomy,"Radical prostatectomy is a surgical procedure that involves the complete removal of the prostate gland along with some surrounding tissue, including the seminal vesicles and sometimes nearby lymph nodes. This procedure is primarily performed to treat localized prostate cancer and aims to eliminate cancerous cells while preserving as much surrounding healthy tissue as possible. It can be done through open surgery or minimally invasive techniques, such as laparoscopic or robotic-assisted surgery. Postoperative recovery may involve managing urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction, which are common side effects."
2,simple prostatectomy,"A simple prostatectomy is a surgical procedure aimed at removing the prostate gland and some surrounding tissue to alleviate symptoms caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or prostate cancer. This procedure is typically performed through an incision in the lower abdomen or via a transurethral approach, depending on the patient's condition and the surgeon's preference. The goal is to relieve urinary obstruction and improve urinary flow while minimizing complications. Recovery time varies, but patients often experience significant improvement in urinary symptoms post-surgery."

34,cystectomy and ilial conduit ,"Cystectomy is a surgical procedure that involves the removal of the bladder, typically due to conditions such as bladder cancer, severe bladder dysfunction, or other significant bladder diseases. Following cystectomy, an ileal conduit is often created to divert urine from the kidneys to an external pouch. This involves taking a segment of the ileum (part of the small intestine) and fashioning it into a conduit that connects the ureters (the tubes carrying urine from the kidneys) to an opening in the abdominal wall, where urine is collected in an external ostomy bag. This procedure allows for the management of urinary output after bladder removal while maintaining kidney function."
